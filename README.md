# Churn Analysis
As a financial services firm, it is very important to know which of your services that clients find most valuable. With this knowledge, you can prioritize discounts and predict which customers you can offer special deals to if you know they are likely to go to a competitor for similar services. To produce an example of this, I am using a dataset from Kaggle entitled "Telco Customer Churn."

This is an example of a classification problem. It's split into two portions - [exploratory analysis](https://github.com/mitchell-jones/churn-analysis/blob/master/Customer%20Churn%20EDA.ipynb) and the process of [building a model](https://github.com/mitchell-jones/churn-analysis/blob/master/Customer%20Churn%20-%20Classification%20Model.ipynb) to predict which customers will churn.

Here's an example of one of the visualizations from the exploratory analysis:

Overall, in this project, I was able to build a variety of models and analyzed which parameters / approaches produce changes in accuracy, precision, and recall. My final result was a Naive Bayes model with 70% accuracy / 83% recall / 65% precision.
